## Executive Summary

We performed a comprehensive security scan of all 71,577 skills on the SkillsMP platform using claude-skill-antivirus's 9 scanning engines.

**Key Finding**: **~3% of skills may have potential risks** that require manual review.

## Risk Distribution

| Risk Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| CRITICAL | 91 | 0.13% |
| HIGH | 626 | 0.87% |
| MEDIUM | 1,310 | 1.83% |
| LOW | 45 | 0.06% |
| **SAFE** | **69,505** | **97.11%** |

## Critical Findings by Category

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Password Manager Access | 41 | Attempts to access 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane |
| Network + Metadata Access | 31 | Combination of network tools and metadata access |
| Browser Credentials | 7 | Accessing browser passwords/cookies |
| Scheduled Exfiltration | 7 | Cron-based data exfiltration patterns |
| Typosquatting | 2 | Suspicious package names (phishing) |
| Sensitive Path Access | 2 | Massive access to sensitive file paths |
| Kubernetes API | 1 | K8s API path access |

## Notable Critical Skills

| Skill Name | Author | Issue |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 1password | clawdbot | Accessing password manager |
| firefox-browser | aiskillstore | Accessing browser passwords/cookies |
| dashlane | clawdbot | Accessing password manager |
| browsing-with-playwright | aiskillstore | Cron scheduled exfiltration |
| managed-chrome-cdp | prateek | Accessing browser passwords/cookies |

## Disclaimer: Potential False Positives

Some findings may be **false positives**. For example:

- **Password manager skills** (1password, bitwarden, dashlane) - These may be legitimate integrations that intentionally interact with password managers
- **Browser automation skills** - Playwright/Puppeteer skills may legitimately need browser access
- **API integration skills** - Skills that fetch data from external APIs may trigger "network + metadata" warnings
- **Official vendor skills** - Skills from `@bitwarden` are likely legitimate Bitwarden tools

**We recommend manually reviewing flagged skills before deciding whether to use them.** The scanner errs on the side of caution - it's better to flag a legitimate skill than miss a malicious one.

## Scanning Engines Used

1. **Dangerous Commands Scanner** - Destructive shell commands
2. **Data Exfiltration Scanner** - Data theft patterns
3. **External Connections Scanner** - URL and network analysis
4. **Permission Scanner** - Tool permissions review
5. **Pattern Scanner** - Prompt injection and sensitive data
6. **MCP Security Scanner** - MCP server configurations
7. **SSRF Scanner** - Server-side request forgery
8. **Dependency Scanner** - Malicious packages detection
9. **Sub-agent Scanner** - Task tool abuse detection

## Methodology

- Scanned all 716 pages of SkillsMP API (100 skills per page)
- Each skill analyzed by all 9 scanning engines
- Risk levels assigned based on severity:
  - **CRITICAL**: -30 points (blocks installation)
  - **HIGH**: -20 points (requires confirmation)
  - **MEDIUM**: -10 points (shows warning)
  - **LOW**: -5 points (verbose mode only)

## Recommendations

1. **For Users**: Always scan skills before installation using `skill-install --scan-only`
2. **For Platform**: Consider reviewing CRITICAL skills for policy compliance
3. **For Authors**: Avoid patterns that access password managers or browser credentials

## How to Reproduce

```bash
npm install -g claude-skill-antivirus

# Scan all SkillsMP skills
skill-batch-scan --api-key <your-api-key> --log-progress

# Scan a single skill
skill-install <skill-source> --scan-only
```
